This is a simple led blinker.  Most boards have an led on GPIO2.

I dont yet know what the IO MUX bit definitions are this is just
how the SDK and others do it, it would be nice to know.

Plenty of rules for this instruction set, and clearly there is a
bootloader that comes before us and does a lot of setup, making
this a bit easier.  We dont need to setup the stack.  The pc
relative addressing appears to want to address to lower valued
addresses with some alignment rules so I have set the bootstrap
and linker so that can happen.

Notice how much simpler my linker script is than the SDK.
Because I dont use the linker script you cant use esptool.py to
get from elf to image.  That file format is pretty simple so have
a tool for that too.

I am not using the SDK but am using the toolchain built from
the same makefiles/repo.
